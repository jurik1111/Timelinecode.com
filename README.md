## 🔷 Project Summary

TimelineCode is a conceptual and technical project aimed at preserving the **eternal digital memory of a person**.  
It includes time-stamped life events, media, memories, and philosophical energy traces —  
all structured into a timeline accessible via QR/NFC and web.

The system is based on:

- Relativistic energy equation: `E² = (mc²)² + (pc)²`
- Digital identity as a persistent energy imprint
- Philosophy of time as memory and motion
